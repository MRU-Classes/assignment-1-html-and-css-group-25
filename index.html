        <h2>About This Website</h2>
        <p>This website has been created as our first assignment in COMP 2511. The basis of this website is to utilize HTML and CSS fundamentals 
          to create our very own personalized website from scratch. Our website consists of three different pages, each showing a different 
          learning aspect and an interactive element for users.</p>

        <h3 id="team">Who are We?</h3>
        <p>We consist of two students whose names are Joshua Joseph and Gabby Vadnais. We are students attending 
          Mount Royal University, and are currently enrolled in the spring semester of COMP 2511. Gabby is a fourth year 
          business student who is minoring in Computer Information Systems. Joshua is a third year student in BCIS. 
          We are both very excited to be taking this course together, and are looking forward to learning more about 
          HTML and CSS. With that being said, we are still new to this so take it easy on us!</p><br>
